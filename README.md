## Overview

<img src="https://www.graalvm.org/resources/img/home/logo-coloured.svg" width=40% height=40%>

The workshop is divided into a number of exercises (each largely self-contained) that cover one aspect of GraalVM. Most of these exercises are applicable to both the GraalVM Community Edition & Enterprise Edition, but some focus on functionality only offered in the Enterprise Edition.


## Credits
This workshop is based on a collection of content and exercises from the likes of Kris Foster, Marthen Luther, Oleg Å elajev, and Chris Seaton.

## Requirements and Installation

In preparation for the workshop, you'll need to ready your system/laptop.

**OS:** MacOS or Linux. Windows is supported by GraalVM but for this workshop, we will not use Windows. These hands-on labs have been tested with Oracle Linux 8.3, Ubuntu 20.04, Fedora 33 (with a minor tweak due to CGroup v2 issue - see the workaround in the later portion of these exercises) and MacOS 10.15.7.

**Tools:** For an optimal lab experience, please install the following tools: `git`, `curl`, `unzip`, Docker or Podman, Apache Maven and your favorite IDE (optional).

**Connectivity:** You will need access to (online) Github repositories during the workshop, so an Internet connection will be necessary.

**Note**: 
Throughout the workshop, when you see a red computer icon ![user input](images/userinput.png) it indicates a command that you'll need to enter in your terminal.
