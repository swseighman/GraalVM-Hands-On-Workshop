## Review

In this workshop, we covered a number of GraalVM Enterprise Edition features, use cases and exercises:

* Installing GraalVM
* High-performance modern JIT compiler for Java]
* Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation
* Polyglot - Combine JavaScript, Java, and R
* Microservices
* SpringBoot and GraalVM Native Image

We demonstrated that GraalVM Enterprise Edition provides significant improvements in application execution and efficiency. From just-in-time compilation to native image building, breaking down the barriers between languages and much more - GraalVM Enterprise is the perfect microservices solution, enabling unmatched speed, agility, and interoperability.

## Next Steps

We can help you assess your current Java environment and provide guidance on how you can achieve your performance goals. Whether you want to focus on minimizing application response times, maximize throughput or improve startup performance, there's good chance GraalVM Enterprise Edition will help. 

Consider scheduling an in-depth discovery session with your Oracle team to discuss Java/GraalVM performance optimization. We're happy to work with you and your team to develop a proof-of-concept.
